# PICTOR: A free-to-use Radio Telescope
PICTOR is an open-source radio telescope that allows anyone to observe the radio sky, using its convenient web platform for free: https://www.pictortelescope.com

## About PICTOR
PICTOR consists of a 1.5-meter parabolic antenna that allows anyone to make continuous and spectral (i.e. [hydrogen line](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/HILine.html)) drift-scan observations of the radio sky in the **1300~1700 MHz** regime for free. 

The goal of this effort is to introduce students, educators, astronomers and others to the majesty of the radio sky, **promoting radio astronomy education**, *without* the need of building a large and expensive radio telescope. 

PICTOR is a **fully open source** (software & hardware) project.

## Technical Details (Telescope Specifications)
**Telescope diameter:** 1.5m (4.92 ft = 59.05")  
**Focal Ratio (F/D):** 0.411 (prime focus antenna)  
**Beamwidth (HPBW @ 1420 MHz):** \~8.95° (*k* factor = 63.64)  
**Operating frequency range:** 1300\~1700 MHz ([L band](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30820/l-band))  
**Two-stage low-noise amplifier (LNA):** Gain: 30 ± 2 dB - Noise figure (NF): < 0.5 dB  
**High-pass filter:** -30 dBc below 900 MHz  
~~**Third-stage LNA (used as an in-line amplifier):** Gain: > 9 dB~~ *  
~~**Band-pass filter:** f_center = 1420 MHz (designed for [hydrogen line](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/HILine.html) observations)~~ *  
**Instantaneous bandwidth (IBW):** up to 3.2 MHz (sufficient for spectral observations) *[to be upgraded to 30.72 MHz]*  
**Number of channels:** up to 2048 (for high frequency-resolution observations) *[to be upgraded to 16384]*
